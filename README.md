# CaliforniaHousingPricePrediction_with_MachineLearning
This data contains information from the 1990 California census. So while it may not help you predict current home prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it provides an accessible introductory dataset to teach people the basics of machine learning.

The 1990 California Census dataset provides a valuable introduction to machine learning through housing data from various California counties. While this dataset is not suitable for predicting current home prices, **it is important for educational purposes for AI that can be useful for predicting current home prices**. In other words, it can be indirectly useful for the continuation of research. This dataset includes features such as geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude), median age of housing, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median home value, and proximity to the ocean.
